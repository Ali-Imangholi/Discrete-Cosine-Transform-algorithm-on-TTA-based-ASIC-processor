Supported Operating Systems
===========================

TCE requires a Unix-style operating system such as Linux. Debian-based
distributions like Debian and Ubuntu should have most of the required
libraries included, but other recent distribution versions should work
fine too. MacOS support is experimental.

The following installation steps install prerequisities, the TCE-patched
LLVM and TCE to in $HOME/local.

Installing Prerequisities
=========================

This step needs root/admin privileges.

For Ubuntus, you need to enable the universe and multiverse repositories first:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding_Repositories_in_Ubuntu

Ubuntu 20.04+
-------------

sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev libboost-all-dev \
 tcl8.6-dev libedit-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxerces-c-dev g++ make \
 latex2html libffi-dev autoconf automake libtool subversion git cmake
 
 
Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
----------------------

Note! Since Ubuntu might install its own libllvm, it can cause a problem with
the TCE-patched LLVM at build time. You might need a workaround that is documented
in this issue https://github.com/cpc/tce/issues/91

  sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libboost-all-dev \
    tcl8.6-dev libedit-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxerces-c-dev g++ make \
    latex2html libffi-dev autoconf automake libtool subversion git cmake


Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
----------------

  sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev libboost-all-dev \
    tcl8.4-dev libedit-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxerces-c2-dev g++ make latex2html \
    libffi-dev autoconf automake libtool subversion git cmake

Debian 7
--------

  sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev libboost-{filesystem,graph,regex,thread}-dev \
    tcl8.4-dev libedit-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxerces-c2-dev g++ make latex2html \
    libffi-dev autoconf automake libtool subversion git cmake

CentOS 6.5
----------

  sudo yum install -y bzr wxGTK-devel boost-devel tcl-devel libedit-devel \
  sqlite-devel xerces-c-devel gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool svn

Get the Latest TCE Source Code
==============================

  git clone https://github.com/cpc/tce.git tce-devel

Alternatively you can get one of the release branches, e.g.:

  git clone -b release-1.21 https://github.com/cpc/tce.git tce-1.21

LLVM and Clang
==============

In order to compile programs from C/C++ with TCE, you need to install
LLVM and Clang with some patches and correct LLVM build switches to fix
issues affecting TCE use.

You can do this easiest by executing

   cd tce-devel/tce
   tools/scripts/install_llvm_10.sh $HOME/local

After successful installation, add information about installed libraries to the
search path. We assume TCE will be installed to the same location later.

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/bin
  export LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib

You might want to put the above environment variable modification commands to
your ~/.bashrc or similar so they are taken in effect automatically whenever
you start a new shell. Otherwise you need to remember to enter them
before attempting to use LLVM or TCE.

Building and Installing TCE
===========================

In the root of TCE sources (e.g. tce-devel/tce), run:

  ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local && make -j8 && make install

Now TCE commands such as 'ttasim' should work. Check this with:

  ttasim --version

Now try to run the smoke test script to see if it finds any problems with
your installation:

Then run the smoke test script:

  tce-selftest -v

If this finished correctly, you are all set! For learning to use TCE, a good
way is to start with the TCE user manual's tutorials, e.g., the "TCE tour".

Upgrading TCE
=============

Later on, if you want to update your TCE installation with the latest changes
committed in the version control system, you can do the following steps:

Update the source code modifications:

  cd tce-devel/tce
  git pull

Build and install the updated TCE:

  make && make install

Further information of library and tools prerequisite versions
==============================================================

These are the current prerequisites for libraries and tools required to
build TCE:

Compiler              supported versions
-----------------     ------------------
GCC                   9.0+

Python                2.4-2.8                              PSF license

Please remember to install the '-dev' versions of the packages in order to get
the library headers which are need to compile client code against them.
You also need a version of "GNU Make" to build TCE.

Editline
--------

Editline is used for command line editing/history browsing capabilities to
the command line interface of the simulator.

You can download the sources here: http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/

Note: this library might require 'termcap' library in some distributions.
The package is named 'libedit-dev' in Debian-based distributions.

Boost
-----
The development files of the following Boost libraries are required by TCE:
. regexp,
. spirit,
. filesystem,
. format,
. thread,
. graph,
. tuple

Some distributions, like Fedora Core, include all Boost libraries in a
single package, but some, like Debian, have separated them in several
packages.
